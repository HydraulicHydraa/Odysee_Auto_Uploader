Most recent patch - 06/03/2022

Fixed an issue where sometimes Japanese (and presumably a bunch of foreign) characters would just get inputted wrong, causing crashes, and worse, 
inaccuracies in the title and description.

I am fully aware of Windows not liking the colon or whatever it was in the log file and will fix or create a Windows version when I get the chance.

Also on the agenda is to make a headless version and create an installer so you guys don't have to try to sift through error messages to install 
all the packages.
